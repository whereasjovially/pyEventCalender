Simple Evented Calendar for Python
==================================

This module provides a simple way to generate calendars with both single day
and multiday events. It uses the same algorithm as Google Calendars does to
pack mutliday events into continuous rows across multiple columns, using the
smallest amount of vertical spacing.

To run the example, simply type:

    python example.py > example.html
